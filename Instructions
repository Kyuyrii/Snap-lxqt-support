The qt-style-kvantum Snap is a Snap that makes Kvantum available to Snap applications, but it's not quite as simple.

Currently, Snap applications don't access the $HOME/.config/Kvantum folder; your Snap must have access to it, or the user must copy it to the Snap application's .config folder.

After adding it, you may need to connect your Snap application to qt-style-kvantum. For example, in the case of melonds-emulator, use this command: sudo snap connect melonds-emulator:kvantum qt-style-kvantum

If you want your application to have access to Kvantum, you need to add everything below.
